# Rill Kaggle Eletric Consumption 

This is a demo project designed to showcase some of our Advanced Measures.

If you have added the full Rill Example project, run `rill start` from this directory to get started.

To run this example specifically:

```
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples.git
cd rill-examples/rill-kaggle-elec-consumption
rill start
```

Rill will build your project from data sources to dashboard and then launch in a new browser window.


## Overview

The data itself is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set

With some simple data modeling to create buckets for the type of voltage and current that is being generated and used in order to demonstrate some advanced measure, you can view the metrics view page to see some of the unique ways you can used Rill.
