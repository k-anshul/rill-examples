# Rill Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples for the Rill application. Make sure you have installed Rill before you get started.

# Install Rill 
```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash
```

# Start Rill
Each example can be started by running `rill start` and then the name of the repository project folder you are interested in exploring.

```
rill start https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples/rill-openrtb-prog-ads.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone this entire repository and run `rill start` inside of the project folder that you are interested in exploring.

```
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/rill-examples.git
cd rill-examples/rill-openrtb-prog-ads
rill start
```


Rill will build your project from data sources to dashboard and then launch in a new browser window.
